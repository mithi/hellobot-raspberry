The Lego Technic 4x4 Crawler set \[9398\] was released in the year 2012. It has 1327 pieces. It also has power functions — electronic modules you can use to control the vehicle . It is approximately 38 x 58 x 9 cubic centimeters and has a weight of around 1.4 kilograms (without batteries).

This is the first Lego Technic set that I built in maybe seven years. I really enjoyed building it and playing with it. It’s not as fast and capable as a real R/C metal crawler put together with screws but I drove it all over over many obstacles; it never skipped gears and it rarely got stuck. Before this, I wanted to learn more about how vehicles worked so I read up on vehicle design from well-known Lego Technic vehicle designers ([Nicjasno](http://www.nicjasno.com/), [Sariel](http://sariel.pl/), [Sheepo](http://sheepo.es/),[Blakbird](http://technicopedia.com/)). Here are some things I learned in the process of understanding a little bit of vehicle/lego/toy design with building this model.

I separated the parts into four articles.

### **[PART0: INTRODUCTION AND TABLE OF CONTENTS](https://legocrawler.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/part-0-introduction-and-table-of-contents/)**

Pretty much self-explanatory. You are here :)

### [PART1: ELECTRICAL ABSTRACTION](https://legocrawler.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/first-blog-post/)

Here I present a block diagram of the connections of the different power functions modules. I briefly explain their functions and how the modules interact with each other to perform steering and to drive the vehicle.

### [PART2: STEERING GEOMETRY](https://legocrawler.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/part-2-steering-geometry/)

In this section, I describe the mechanism in which the servo steers the axles of the wheels. It uses a simple rack and pinion connected to a four-bar linkages (that has a slight Ackerman geometry).

### [PART3: SUSPENSIONS AND WHEEL ALIGNMENTS](https://legocrawler.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/part-3-suspensions-and-wheel-alignments/)

Here I discuss the purpose of the suspensions and the wheel alignments. I also discuss how the of the Lego crawler (suspensions and wheel alignments) compares to vehicles in real life.

### [PART4: MISCELLANEOUS THOUGHTS AND SUMMARY](https://legocrawler.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/part-4-miscellaneous-thoughts-and-summary/)

Before concluding with a summary, I point out some of the things I noticed about the power transmission (gears), differentials, weight distribution, tires, and ground clearance.
